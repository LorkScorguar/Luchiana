or installServer.py if you are on the server

------------------------LAUNCH------------------------
To launch the server:
cd server
python3.x LuchianaServer.py

To launch client in Python2.x:
cd client
python2.x LuchianaClient.py

To launch client in Python3.x:
cd client3
python3.x LuchianaClient.py


------------------------USING------------------------
to use speech recognition, type "p" and press Enter, then speak
to use speech synthesis, type "Parle!" and press Enter


------------------------DEVELOP------------------------
To add a new module:
add the import MODULE line in server/Cerveau.py
write the sentences for using it as describe in server/database/* files

Regex;action type;action;answers

Regex=regex to match
action type=can be "rep" for quick answer, "bash" or python if an action is needed
action=if needed, an action to realise
answers=all possible answers separates by /

Those variables are usable in action:
%IN%=the "important" value in a sentence according to the brain
%PHRASE%=the sentence as send by the user

The two above and the one below are available in answers:
%OUT%=the answer from your module
